- This comes from a local max cut instance:
  players {1,2,3} are nodes; edge weight{1,2} = 2; weight{1,3} = -1; weight{2,3} = 2
- Pure strategies {a,b} encode if respective player is on left or right of the cut
- The payoff to a player is the sum of their incident edges across the implied cut
- Pure equilibrium iff local max cuts; in addition, uniform mixture is an equilibrium
- Equilibrium analysis for pure profiles:
    a a a:  0 0  0 -- Not Nash (regrets: 1, 4, 1)
    b a a:  1 2 -1 -- Not Nash (regrets: 0, 0, 3)
    a b a:  2 4  2 -- Nash (global max cut)
    b b a: -1 2  1 -- Not Nash (regrets: 3, 0, 0)
    a a b: -1 2  1 -- Not Nash (regrets: 3, 0, 0)
    b a b:  2 4  2 -- Nash (global max cut)
    a b b:  1 2 -1 -- Not Nash (regrets: 0, 0, 3)
    b b b:  0 0  0 -- Not Nash (regrets: 1, 4, 1)
