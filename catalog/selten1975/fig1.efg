EFG 2 R "Selten's horse (Selten IJGT 1975, Figure 1)" { "Player 1" "Player 2" "Player 3" }
"This is a three-player game presented in Selten [^Sel1975], commonly referred
to as \"Selten's horse\" owing to the layout in which it can be drawn.
It is the motivating example for his definition of (trembling-hand)
perfect equilibrium, by showing a game that has an equilibrium which
is \"unreasonable\", but which is not ruled out by subgame perfection because
this game has no proper subgames.
