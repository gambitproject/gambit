// that have no strategy, at an active infoset, that is weakly dominated by
// another active strategy, either in the conditional sense (for any active
// node in the infoset) or the unconditional sense.  In addition we 
// check for domination by strategys that are inactive, but whose activation
// would not activate any currently inactive infosets, so that the
// subsupport resulting from activation is consistent, in the sense
// of having active strategys at all active infosets, and not at other
// infosets.
