These are some sketches of Python codes that implement certain common symmetric games
in pure Python rather than using the underlying C++ representation.

They are not currently maintained vis-a-vis the current pygambit implementation.
However, they are intended to be suggestive of how to provide codes to generate/implement
common games, with an aim to eventual integration as a pygambit feature.
