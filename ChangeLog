	accept '.' as first key

	* gui/dleditbehav.cc, gui/dleditmixed.cc: General fixup of feel for
	editing; use NumberEditor in grid.

2002-09-30  Ted Turocy  <arbiter@econ.tamu.edu>

	* This begins work on 0.97.0.3

	* nash/behavsol.cc: Fixups for some of the property-computing

	to setting cell editor when creating new outcome via pressing Enter

2002-09-24  Ted Turocy  <arbiter@econ.tamu.edu>

	* gui/?fgprofile.cc, gui/?fgoutcome.cc: Changed context menu items to

	* nash/*, gcl/solfunc.cc, gui/efgprofile.cc, gui/nfgprofile.cc: 
	Replaced algorithm enum with text identifiers; fixes bug in which some
	profiles' creators were not correctly identified (labeled as "User" instead).

	* gui/?fgshow.*: Keep profile lists synchronized on profile delete.

	* gui/nfgtable.(cc,h), gui/nfgshow.cc: Various largely cosmetic

2002-09-05  Ted Turocy  <arbiter@econ.tamu.edu>

	changing the player dropdown.

	* gui/efgshow.(cc,h), gui/efgoutcome.cc, gui/nfgshow.(cc,h),
	gui/nfgoutcome.cc: Cosmetic fix so that new outcomes have displayed
	payoffs; added automatic generation of unique outcome labels.
