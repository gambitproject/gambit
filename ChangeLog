# Changelog

## [16.1.0a2] - unreleased

### Changed
- `pygambit.supports` has been introduced to organise algorithms which operates on sets
  of pure strategies or actions, such as finding undominated strategies.


## [16.1.0a1] - 2023-09-14

### Changed
- Cython 3.0 is now used for pygambit.
- Documentation of the pygambit API has been moved into docstrings.
- Chance action probabilities are now enforced to sum to exactly one at an information
  set.  This is accomplished by changing the API to set probabilities for all actions
  simultaneously; it is no longer possible to assign an action probability individually.

### Added
- Documented support in Python for estimating quantal response equilibria using
  either fixed-point or empirical payoff methods

### Fixed
- Corrected reference counting for C++ Game objects which could result in objects
  never being deallocated (see #331)
- Corrected Lyapunov function minimisation returning critical points that are
  not global minima (i.e. not equilibria) (#329)
- Corrected a regression in accessing contingencies of a game in Python.
- Removed use of explicit StopIteration (a holdover from Python 2.x support).

	

## [16.0.2] - 2022-01-28

### Fixed
- Updated build and packaging systems for current compilers across all platforms
- Refactored Python implementation to make pygambit PyPI-installable
