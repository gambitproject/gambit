# Changelog

## [16.1.1] - unreleased

### Fixed
- In gambit-logit, if there are chance actions with zero probability, information sets may be reached
  with zero probability.  In this event, gambit-logit treats beliefs at those information sets as being
  uniform across nodes (#63)
- Corrected outdated code in `fit_fixedpoint` and `fit_empirical`, and added extended documentation
  of both methods (#1)



## [16.1.0] - 2023-11-09

### Fixed
- Fixed regression in Game.from_dict() causing the method to fail (PR #399 by AbhijeetKrishnan)
- In `gambit-logit` on extensive games, a spurious final value was being emitted on each line of the
  CSV output; this has been removed.


## [16.1.0b1] - 2023-11-06

### Added
- Implement MixedBehaviorProfile.realiz_prob to return probability node is reached under the profile.

### Fixed
- When an action at a chance node is deleted the probabilities for the remaining actions are 
  normalized.

### Changed
- The gambit-enumpoly solver has been marked as "experimental" and is no longer built by default, nor
  is it available via the graphical interface.


## [16.1.0a4] - 2023-10-13

### Changed
- Empty or all-whitespace strings cannot be used to access members of games in pygambit.
- Remaining compatibility code for wxWidgets 2.x removed from graphical interface.
- Migrated to pytest for testing of pygambit.
- ValueErrors raised for mixed behavior profiles when payoff, action_value, or infoset_value are
  called with the chance player.
- Implemented Game.delete_strategy to remove a strategy from a strategic game.
- Implemented regret for mixed strategy profiles.

### Fixed
- Regret on mixed behavior profiles now implements the standard definition of regret
  (loss in expected payoff relative to best response conditional on reaching the information set).


## [16.1.0a3] - 2023-09-29

### Changed
- The `refine` and `leash` parameters to simpdiv have been made available and documented in
  pygambit.
- Repackage logit solver in src/solvers; make pygambit.nash.logit_solve available as a
  method for finding a Nash equilibrium.
- Additional game transformation operations have been moved to the Game class, and old versions
  deprecated.
- Accessing payoffs of outcomes and pure strategy profiles is now standardized to use player
  references, and accessing by index has been removed.
- Game.num_nodes has been removed in favor of Game.nodes, which returns a list of the nodes
  in the game.


## [16.1.0a2] - 2023-09-22

### Changed
- Most operations which modify games have been moved to being operations on `Game` instead of
  being operations on classes representing elements of games.  For the most part old versions
  have been retained with a deprecation warning; these old versions will be removed in 16.2.0.
- `pygambit.supports` has been introduced to organise algorithms which operates on sets
  of pure strategies or actions, such as finding undominated strategies.
- `.payoff()` on mixed strategy and mixed behavior profiles now takes either a Player or string label.
  `.infoset_value()` and `.action_value()` have been introduced to replace calling `.payoff()` on
  these objects.
- The implementation of mixed strategy profiles and mixed behavior profiles has been thoroughly rewritten
  for improved consistency in behavior across members and between the two types of profile.
- The experimental concept of a `StrategicRestriction` has been removed from `pygambit`.
  Instead, calling `restrict` on a `StrategySupportProfile` creates a deep copy of its
  game with only the strategies specified.


## [16.1.0a1] - 2023-09-14

### Changed
- Cython 3.0 is now used for pygambit.
- Documentation of the pygambit API has been moved into docstrings.
- Chance action probabilities are now enforced to sum to exactly one at an information
  set.  This is accomplished by changing the API to set probabilities for all actions
  simultaneously; it is no longer possible to assign an action probability individually.

### Added
- Documented support in Python for estimating quantal response equilibria using
  either fixed-point or empirical payoff methods

### Fixed
- Corrected reference counting for C++ Game objects which could result in objects
  never being deallocated (see #331)
- Corrected Lyapunov function minimisation returning critical points that are
  not global minima (i.e. not equilibria) (#329)
- Corrected a regression in accessing contingencies of a game in Python.
- Removed use of explicit StopIteration (a holdover from Python 2.x support).

	

## [16.0.2] - 2022-01-28

### Fixed
- Updated build and packaging systems for current compilers across all platforms
- Refactored Python implementation to make pygambit PyPI-installable
