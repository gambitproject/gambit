:download:`2x2x2.nfg <../contrib/games/2x2x2.nfg>`
  A three-player normal form game with two strategies per player.
  This game has nine Nash equilibria,
  which is the maximal number of regular Nash equilibria possible
  for a game of this size. See
  `McKelvey, Richard D. and McLennan, Andrew (1997).
  The maximal number of regular totally mixed Nash equilibria.
  Journal of Economic Theory 72(2): 411-425.

:download:`2x2x2-nau.nfg <../contrib/games/2x2x2-nau.nfg>`
  A three-player normal form game with two strategies per player.
  This game has three pure strategy equilibria, two
  equilibria which are incompletely mixed, and a continuum of
  completely mixed equilibria. This game appears as an example in
  `Nau, Robert, Gomez Canovas, Sabrina, and Hansen, Pierre (2004).
  On the geometry of Nash equilibria and correlated equilibria.
  International Journal of Game Theory 32(4): 443-453.

:download:`bagwell.efg <../contrib/games/bagwell.efg>`
  Stackelberg leader game with imperfectly observed commitment,
  from `Bagwell, Kyle (1993) Commitment and observability in games.
  Games and Economic Behavior 8: 271-280.
  <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0899-8256(05)80001-6>`_

:download:`bayes2a.efg <../contrib/games/bayes2a.efg>`
  A twice-repeated Bayesian game, with two players, each having two
  types and two actions. This game also illustrates the use of payoffs
  at nonterminal nodes in Gambit, which can substantially simplify the
  representation of multi-stage games such as this.

:download:`cent3.efg <../contrib/games/cent3.efg>`
  A three-stage centipede game, featuring an exogenous probability
  that one player is an altruistic type, who always passes.
  See, for example,
  `McKelvey, Richard D. and Palfrey, Thomas R. (1992) An
  experimental study of the centipede game.  Econometrica 60(4):
  803-836. <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2951567>`_

:download:`condjury.efg <../contrib/games/condjury.efg>`
  A three-person Condorcet jury game, after the analysis of
  `Feddersen, Timothy and Pesendorfer, Wolfgang (1998)
  Convicting the innocent: The inferiority of unanimous jury verdicts
  under strategic voting. American Political Science Review 92(1):
  23-35. <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2585926>`_.

:download:`loopback.nfg <../contrib/games/loopback.nfg>`
  A game due to McKelvey which illustrates that the logit quantal
  response equilibrium correspondence can have a "backward-bending"
  segment on the principal branch.

:download:`montyhal.efg <../contrib/games/montyhal.efg>`
  The famous
  `Monty Hall problem
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem>`_: if Monty offers
  to let you switch doors, should you?

:download:`nim.efg <../contrib/games/nim.efg>`
  This is a Nim-like game, which is a useful example of the value
  of backward induction.
  This version starts with one pile of five stones, and allows the
  two players to alternately take 1 or 2 stones.
  The player to take the last stone wins.
  The classic game of
  `Nim <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim>`_ allows multiple piles,
  and allows a player to remove any number of stones from a pile.
  An interesting experimental study of Nim games is

  learning: Heuristics and response time in perfect information
  games. Games and Economic Behavior 79:
  223-232. <http:dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geb.2013.02.003>`_

:download:`pbride.efg <../contrib/games/pbride.efg>`
  A signaling game from
  `Joel Watson's Strategy textbook
  <http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=4294969499>`_,
  modeling the confrontation in The Princess Bride between Humperdinck
  and Roberts in the bedchamber.

:download:`poker.efg <../contrib/games/poker.efg>`
  A simple game of one-card poker introduced in
  `Myerson, Roger (1991) Game Theory: Analysis of Conflict.
  <http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674341166>`_.
  A bit unusually for poker, the "fold" action by a player with a
  strong hand counts for a win for that player, so folding is only
  weakly rather than strictly dominated in this case.

:download:`4cards.efg <../contrib/games/4cards.efg>`
  A slightly more complex poker example, contributed by Alix Martin.

:download:`spence.efg <../contrib/games/spence.efg>`
  A version of Spence's classic job-market signaling game. This version
  comes from `Joel Watson's Strategy textbook
  <http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=4294969499>`_.


These games, and others, ship in the standard Gambit source
distribution in the directory `contrib/games`.
