The Gambit Project is a project for the development of computer code
for the solution of extensive and normal form games.  The software
developed under the project is distributed under the GNU General Public
License.  The Gambit Project has been
funded in the past by National Science Foundation grants SBR-9308637 and
SBR-9617854 to the California Institute of Technology and SBR-9308862
to the University of Minnesota.</para>

      <para>
The Gambit Project was founded in the mid-1980s by Richard McKelvey.
The original implementation was a graphical interface written in
BASIC.  The code was ported to C around 1990 with the help of
Bruce Bell, and this version was distributed publicly as
version 0.13 in 1991 and 1992.
	</para>

      <para>
A major step in the evolution of Gambit took place with the awarding
of the NSF grants in 1994, with McKelvey and Andrew McLennan as
principal investigators.  The grants sponsored a complete rewrite
of Gambit in C++, with the code taking essentially the organization it
has today.  The graphical interface was made portable across
platforms through the use of the wxWindows library
(<ulink url="http://www.wxwindows.org">http://www.wxwindows.org</ulink>),
and a scripting language,
the Gambit Command Language, was developed.  Version 0.94 of Gambit
was released in the late summer of 1994, and version 0.96 followed in 1999.

Many other individuals have contributed to the project, by coding,
documenting, and testing, especially students at Caltech and the
University of Minnesota.  We wish to acknowledge their contributions

The project especially wishes to thank Bernhard von Stengel,
of the London School of Economics,  
for help and advice on implementation of the sequence form
and for contributing his &quot;clique&quot; code for identification of
equilibrium components in two person games.
      </para>

      <para>
Version 0.97.0.1 of Gambit was released on September 1, 2002.  This
release featured
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
A completely redesigned graphical user interface, built with the
wxWindows 2.3.2 cross-platform toolkit.  Previous releases of 
Gambit used the older 1.xx series of wxWindows.  The new version provides
substantially greater functionality and stability.  The interface
redesign should make many game creation tasks easier.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
An implementation of a new algorithm for computing the logistic
quantal response equilibrium correspondence, as described in
<citation><xref linkend="Tur02"></citation>.  This algorithm is now
essentially unlimited in the size of lambda it can compute, and is
much faster than the previous implementation provided by Gambit.  This
algorithm is now recommended for computing one Nash equilibrium, especially
in games with more than two players.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
A new function minimization implementation, derived from that available
in the GNU Scientific Library, is used in the Lyapunov function minimization
algorithm (<function>LiapSolve</function>).  It appears this implementation
is at least somewhat superior to that provided in previous versions.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
The command language interface for Windows has been replaced with a new
one built with wxWindows.  Additionally, this windowed interface is also
available under *nix (called <application>wxgcl</application>).

<sect1 id="intro.versioning">
<title>Gambit versions and version numbers</title>

<para>
Beginning with version 0.97, Gambit versions will be numbered in the form
<literal>0.x.y.z</literal>, where <literal>x</literal> is the 
&quot;major&quot; version number, <literal>y</literal> is the
&quot;minor&quot; version number, and <literal>z</literal> is the
&quot;micro&quot; (or &quot;patch&quot;) version number.  The initial
zero in the version number is there for historical reasons.  Gambit
follows the Linux kernel numbering style: releases deemed
&quot;stable&quot; will have even minor version numbers, and releases
deemed &quot;unstable&quot; will have odd minor version numbers.  So,
version 0.97.0.1 is the first release in the stable 0.97.0 series;
version 0.97.1.1 will be the first release in the unstable 0.97.1 series.
</para>

<para>
The goal is to release a new initial stable version in a series on
a schedule roughly corresponding to the academic year (at least, for those
on the semester system), for the benefit of those who like to use Gambit
for instructional purposes.  So, for example, version 0.97.0.1 was released
on September 1, 2002; this is a stable release, and any future releases of
0.97.0.z will correspond to bug fixes and patches.
At some point in the fall, releases numbered 0.97.1.z will begin to appear;
these will contain relatively major innovations and changes relative
to the 0.97.0 series.  Finally, when the 0.97.1 series stabilizes, it
will be released, hopefully over the holidays, as version 0.97.2.0.
</para>

<para>
Which version of Gambit you should use depends on your needs.  For classroom
use, we'd certainly recommend the current stable version, since nothing
will frustrate your students faster than having the program crash on them
in the middle of their homework.  For research use, you may find either
of them appropriate; while the &quot;unstable&quot; series might be a bit
buggy, it may also have some features you'll find useful.  Finally, if
you're interested in contributing to Gambit, you'll definitely want to
work with the unstable series, since that represents the latest-and-greatest
on the bleeding edge of computational game theory development.

<title>Gambit release history</title>

<para>
This is an outline of the release history of Gambit (at least in the
&quot;postmodern&quot; era beginning with release 0.97.0.1).
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Version 0.97.0.1, released September 1, 2002:  Initial public release,
with rebuilt graphical interface, new implementations of 
<function>QreSolve</function> and <function>LiapSolve</function>, and
a new windowed interface for the command language.

<sect1 id="intro.getting">
<title>Getting and installing Gambit</title>
<para>
The development and testing of Gambit takes place primarily
on the following platforms:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Microsoft Windows 95, 98 and NT, using the free Borland C++ 5.5
compiler.  The binary distributions for Windows should work on
other versions of Windows, but may not be tested.  Reports are
always welcome.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
RedHat Linux 6.x and 7.x, using wxWindows, the GTK toolkit and
<application>gcc</application>.  The wxWindows library
also supports Motif/Lesstif, and the code should compile
on other flavors of Linux and Unix; again, however, these
may not be tested.  Again, reports are always welcome.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
The latest stable and unstable releases of Gambit can always
be found at the Gambit website at
<ulink url="http://www.hss.caltech.edu/gambit">http://www.hss.caltech.edu/gambit</ulink>.
You can build Gambit from source, in which case you will need one
of the compilers mentioned above, and the appropriate version of 
wxWindows.  Build instructions are found in the file INSTALL in the
main directory of the source distribution.  Gambit is also distributed
in binary form for Windows, in which case you don't need the compiler
or wxWindows installed.  There currently are not any prebuilt binaries
for *nix.

<sect1 id="intro.about">
<title>About this manual</title>

<para>
This manual is written with the assumption the reader is familiar with
the basic terms and concepts of game theory.  Where possible, Gambit
uses terminology standard in game theory; definitions of game-theoretic
concepts will only be introduced where confusion may occur.  
Game theory novices should supplement this manual with a standard text
on the topic; a list of some of these is given in the
<xref linkend="bib">.
</para>

<para>
Beginning with version 0.97, the Gambit manual is written using DocBook.
This manual can always be browsed online at the Gambit website, and can
be downloaded in HTML and PDF formats for local use.
</para>

<note>
<title>Changes from previous versions</title>
<para>
This manual, particularly the graphical interface sections, has been
substantially overhauled since the last release.  As a result, it is
still in flux.  Please report any areas in which the manual is unclear
or lacking to the Gambit address.
</para>
<para>
Throughout the manual, changes from previous versions are highlighted
in notes, such as this one.
