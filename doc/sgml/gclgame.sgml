<title>Constructing and manipulating games</title>

<para>
The whole point of the GCL is to provide an environment to enable
building and doing computations on games.  This chapter describes how
to build and solve normal and extensive form games in the GCL.

<title>Normal form games</title>

<para>
A normal form game is a set of players, each with a strategy
set, together with a function from the cartesian product of strategy
sets to a set of outcomes. Each outcome results in a payoff to each of
the players.  To construct a normal form game, one must therefore
define each of these parts.  A collection of GCL functions is available
for building and editing normal form games.  A complete list is given
in the sections on ``Normal Form Manipulation'' in the Categorical
Function Reference section of the manual.  The most generally-useful
functions are given in the table.

<title>Creating a normal form game</title>

<para>
The function <function>NewNfg</function>
is used to create a new normal form game.  Thus, the expression
<programlisting>
GCL1:= NewNfg[{2,3,2}]
</programlisting>
will create a new normal form game with three players, where the first
player has two strategies, the second player has three strategies, and
the third player has two strategies.  Since no outcomes have been
defined, all strategy tuples of pure strategies result in the
null outcome, which has payoff of zero for all players.  
</para>

<para>
The game created by <function>NewNfg</function> is not very interesting, because all
payoffs for all strategies are zero.  To make it more interesting,
outcomes must be created and associated with strategy tuples.  To
create a separate outcome for each pure strategy, one can specify the
second argument in <function>NewNfg</function> to be <literal>True</literal>.
These outcomes
will still have zero payoffs until they are changed. The function
<function>Randomize</function>
can be used to randomize the payoffs of each outcome
in the game.  In this way, <function>NewNfg</function> can be used to create
more interesting games by using it as an argument to other functions
that accept normal form games as arguments.
</para>

<para>
For example, to create a random two person 2 by 2 normal form
game, with a seed of 34 for the random number generator, you can
use the function <function>Randomize</function> to randomize the payoffs of the
original game:
<programlisting>
GCL2:= Randomize[NewNfg[{2,2},True],34]
</programlisting>
You can look at the payoffs of the game by using the user-defined function
from <filename>stdudfs.gcl</filename>,
<function>Payoffs</function> (using <function>Float</function>
to convert the payoffs of the game to floating
point precision first):
<programlisting>
GCL3:= << Payoffs[Float[Randomize[NewNfg[{2,2},True],34]]]
{ { { 0.159964, 0.026784 }, { 0.421515, 0.399322 } },
  { { 0.233245, 0.923402 }, { 0.039071, 0.695271 } } }
</programlisting>
Here, the payoffs are written in a nested list, where the
\verb+(i,j)+th component is the vector of payoffs when player 1 takes
strategy <varname>i</varname> and player 2 takes strategy <varname>j</varname>.
The game can be solved for all mixed Nash equilibria by
<programlisting>
GCL4:= << AllNash[Randomize[NewNfg[{2,2},True],34]]
{ (Mixed) { 1.000000 0.000000 }{ 0.000000 1.000000 },
  (Mixed) { 0.000000 1.000000 }{ 1.000000 0.000000 },
  (Mixed) { 0.379795 0.620205 }{ 0.839199 0.160801 } }
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
In all of the above examples, all work is thrown out, and the normal
form game is created anew in each successive command.  You can avoid
such wasteful computation, and minimize the typing you need to do by
saving intermediate results in a variable.  For example, the above
could be done as follows:
<programlisting>
GCL1:= n:=Randomize[NewNfg[{2,2},True],34];
GCL2:= p:=Payoffs[n];
GCL3:= m:=EnumMixedSolve[n];
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The first statement creates a variable <varname>n</varname>
to store the normal
form game.  This variable is then used as an argument in the next two
function calls.  The second two statements create variables
<varname>p</varname> and <varname>m</varname>
to store the nested list of payoffs of the game, and the
list of mixed strategy solutions of the game.  Any of these variables
can then be used as input to other function calls, as long as the data
type of the variable is the same as the data type of the 
</para>

<para>
The above also illustrates another important principle of the GCL.
All of the functions in the GCL (with a few exeptions, noted in the
Function Reference Section) return objects of some specific data type.
Any object returned by a function can be stored in a variable.  While
the GCL supports a large number specialized data types, the data
typing is all implicit.  In other words, you never have to declare
what data type a variable will be before it is used.  A variable takes
on the data type of the object that is first assigned to it.    
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Setting payoffs</title>

<para>
The payoffs in a normal form can be set to have specific values using
the <function>SetPayoff</function> function.
The following sequence of expressions
illustrates how to build a simple prisoner's dilemma game, by first
creating a normal form game with the appropriate number of players and
strategies, and then
modifying the payoffs one by one.  
<programlisting>
GCL1:= n:=NewNfg[{2,2}]
GCL2:= s:=Strategies[n]
GCL3:= NewOutcome[{s_1_1,s_2_1},{9.0,9.0}]
GCL4:= NewOutcome[{s_1_1,s_2_2},{0.0,10.0}]
GCL5:= NewOutcome[{s_1_2,s_2_1},{10.0,0.0}]
GCL6:= NewOutcome[{s_1_2,s_2_2},{1.0,1.0}]
GCL7:= << Payoffs[n]
{ { { 9.000000, 9.000000 }, { 0.000000, 10.000000 } },
  { { 10.000000, 0.000000 }, { 1.000000, 1.000000 } } }
</programlisting>
Note that the above can be done equivalently and more simply by using
the standard user-defined function, <function>Nfg</function>,
to create the game directly from a payoff list:
<programlisting>
GCL1:= n:=Nfg[{{{9,9},{0,10}},{{10,0},{1,1}}}]
GCL2:= << Payoffs[n]
{ { { 9.000000, 9.000000 }, { 0.000000, 10.000000 } },
  { { 10.000000, 0.000000 }, { 1.000000, 1.000000 } } }
</programlisting>
You can name the strategies if you want by using <function>Strategies</function> to
get a list of the strategies in the game, and <function>SetName</function> to name
them.
<programlisting>
GCL3:= s:=Strategies[n]
GCL4:= SetName[s_1,{"Cooperate","Defect"}]
GCL5:= SetName[s_2,{"Cooperate","Defect"}]
GGCL6:= << Name[s]
{ { Cooperate, Defect },
  { Cooperate, Defect } }
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
We now give a more complicated example, in which one can use
listability of vector and matrix operations to set the payoffs in the
normal form according to a formula.  In this example, we create a
version of the ``stag hunt'' game.
<programlisting>
GCL1:= << strat:=List[1,3,1]
{ 1, 2, 3 }
GCL2:= << stratSets:=List[strat,2]
{ { 1, 2, 3 },
  { 1, 2, 3 } }
GCL3:= << effort:=CartesianProd[stratSets] 
{ { { 1, 1 }, { 1, 2 }, { 1, 3 } },
  { { 2, 1 }, { 2, 2 }, { 2, 3 } },
  { { 3, 1 }, { 3, 2 }, { 3, 3 } } }
GCL4:= << pay:=Min[effort]-.5*effort
{ { { 0.500, 0.500 }, { 0.500, 0.000 }, { 0.500, -0.500 } },
  { { 0.000, 0.500 }, { 1.000, 1.000 }, { 1.000, 0.500 } },
  { { -0.500, 0.500 }, { 0.500, 1.000 }, { 1.500, 1.500 } } }
GCL5:= << n:=Nfg[pay]
(Nfg) ""
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
First, the set of effort levels for a player (consisting of the list
of integers from one to 3) is constructed and stored in the variable
<varname>strat</varname>.  (While this variable is called 
<varname>strat</varname>, its data
type is <type>LIST(INTEGER)</type>, not <type>STRATEGY</type>.)
Second, the set
of strategy sets for both players is assembled in <varname>stratSets</varname>.
Third, the set of pure strategy profiles is assembled by taking the
cartesian product of the strategy sets, and converted to <type>NUMBER</type>
to give a vector of efforts for each pure strategy profile.  The
result is stored in the variable <varname>effort</varname>.
Fourth, the vector of
payoffs for each pure strategy profile is computed by taking, for
vector of payoffs, the minimum effort across players, and subtracting
the cost of effort for each player.  Finally, a game is constructed
with these payoffs, by using the function <function>Nfg</function>.
If you now ask
to see the payoffs for the game via <function>Payoffs[nfg]</function>,
you will see an array just like <varname>pay</varname>.
</para>

<para>
The fourth step in the above calculation illustrates a subtle but
important point about listable functions.  The function
<function>Min</function> requires an argument of type
<type>LIST(NUMBER)</type> and returns type <type>NUMBER</type>.  It is
being called with an argument of type
<type>LIST(LIST(LIST(NUMBER)))</type>, with dimension 3 by 3 by 2.
Hence, the function will be run as a listable function on the
innermost vectors in the nested list, generating a result of type
<type>LIST(LIST(NUMBER))</type>, with dimension 3 by 3, each entry of
which contains the minimum of the vector in that cell.  Thus:
<programlisting>
GCL6:= << Min[effort]
{ { 1, 1, 1 },
  { 1, 2, 2 },
  { 1, 2, 3 } }
</programlisting>
To subtract the component .5*effort from this, the function
<function>Minus</function> requires data of type 
<type>NUMBER</type> for both arguments.
It is being run with the first argument of type
<type>LIST(LIST(NUMBER))</type> with dimension 3 by 3, and the second of
type <type>LIST(LIST(LIST(NUMBER)))</type>, with dimension 3 by 3 by 2.
The first two levels of the list for both arguments match
in dimension.  Then it encounters a <type>NUMBER</type> in the first
argument, and a <type>LIST(NUMBER)</type> of dimension 2 on the second.
Hence, <type>Minus</type> runs listably on its second argument, yielding a
<type>LIST(NUMBER)</type> of dimension 2 for each entry in the 3 by 3
nested list of <function>Min[effort]</function>.
</para>

<para>
The functions used in the above construction will accept nested lists
of any level.  Hence, the above can be extended into a user defined
function which allows one to build a stag hunt game for an arbitrary
number of players and strategies:
<programlisting>
NewFunction[StagHuntNfg[n->INTEGER,maxeff->INTEGER,cost->NUMBER]=:NFG,
  strats:=List[1,maxeff,1];
  effort:=CartesianProd[List[strats,n]];
  Nfg[Min[effort]-cost*effort];
];
</programlisting>
The expressions in this user defined function are analagous to the
steps in the two person example above.  Once the above function has
been defined, then you can then use it as follows:
<programlisting>
n:=StagHuntNfg[4,2,.5];
</programlisting>
to create a four person stag hunt game where each player has two
strategy choices (effort levels) and the cost of effort is .5.
</para>

<para>
Once a normal form game has been defined, there are a number of
solution algorithms that can be applied to solve the game.  How to
solve normal form games is discussed in the next chapter.  Until you
get to that point, you might want to save your work.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Saving and loading normal form games</title>

<para>
Once a normal form game has been constructed, it can be saved in a
similar way to an extensive form game.  The expression
<programlisting>
SaveNfg[n, "filename.nfg"]
</programlisting>
will save the normal form game <varname>n</varname> to the file
<filename>filename.nfg</filename>. 
It is recommended that the filename extension
<filename>.nfg</filename> be used when saving normal form games, as the Gambit
graphical user interface recognizes this extension as containing normal
form games.  Once a normal form game has been saved to an external
file, it can be loaded by the command <function>LoadNfg</function>,
as follows:
<programlisting>
n := LoadNfg["filename.nfg"]
</programlisting>
</para>

<sect3>
<title>Creating a new extensive form</title>

<para>
The function <function>NewEfg</function> can be used to create a
new extensive form
game.  In order to do anything with it, a variable should be created
to be the new extensive form game.  Thus, the expression
<programlisting>
e := NewEfg[]
</programlisting>
will create a new extensive form game stored in <varname>e</varname>.
The game is a trivial game with only one node, the root node, and
no players (besides the chance player used to represent the realizations
of random events).  You can create a game which 
has two players, named Fred and Alice, by specifying
<programlisting>
e := NewEfg[{"Fred", "Alice"} ]
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
For an arbitrary extensive form game, a number of functions are
available to get information about the game.  A complete list is given
in the section on ``Getting Information'' in the Categorical Function
Reference section of this manual.  Some of the more important
functions are given in the table.

The functions in the table can be used to build up any valid extensive
form game from a trivial game.  The basic procedure by which a more
complex game is constructed from a simple game is:
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Create a new game, and create all players.  
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Iteratively add moves to the game.  This involves two steps
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Construct a ``template'' for a move by creating an information set for
a player with the desired choices (actions).  
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Add the move to the game for the appropriate histories of actions.  
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Reveal information about the moves to players that observe them.  
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Compute payoffs and attach outcomes to the game.  
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>
The next to last step (revealing information) may require considerable
care for games with complex information structures.  It is usually
easiest to wait to do this step until the entire game tree is built,
since Gambit does not maintain a game of perfect recall as
you add new moves.  Hence, if you reveal a move of player 1 to player
2, and then add new moves to the game for the player 2, the move that
was revealed to player 2 will not be ``remembered'' by player 2 at the
new moves.
</para>

<para>
The following sequence of commands builds the game tree for a simple
poker game as described in <citation><xref linkend="Mye91"></citation>,
as outlined below.
</para>

<literallayout>
                         Game Description:

Fred (Player 1) and Alice (Player 2) each ante $1.00 into the pot.
Fred draws a card from a deck; Fred observes the card; Alice does not. 
Fred moves:
  If Fred Folds, 
    Fred wins the pot if his card is Red (net gain of $1.00 to Fred).
    Fred loses the pot if his card is Black (net loss of $1.00 to Fred).
  If Fred Raises, then Fred throws a dollar in the pot, and Alice moves:
    If Alice Passes, then Fred wins the pot (net gain of $1.00 to Fred)
    If Alice Meets, she throws a dollar in the pot; Fred must show the card: 
      If the card is Red Fred wins the pot (net gain of $2.00 to Fred).
      If the card is Black Alice wins the pot (net loss of $2.00 to Fred)
</literallayout>

<para>
To construct this game, first we create a new game, and the players.
We create the players separately, using <function>NewPlayer</function>
so that we
have variables to refer to them later:
<programlisting>
e := NewEfg[];
fred := NewPlayer[ e, "Fred"];
alice := NewPlayer[e,"Alice"];
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
Now, we iteratively add moves to the game, by creating an information
set with a template for the move, and then adding that move to the
game at the appropriate histories: 

<programlisting>
deal := NewInfoset[ Chance[e], {"Red", "Black"}];
AddMove[deal,RootNode[e]];
fredmove := NewInfoset[ fred , {"Raise", "Fold"} ];
AddMove[ fredmove, TerminalNodes[e]];
alicemove := NewInfoset[ alice , {"Meet", "Pass"} ];
fredraised:=Filter[t:=TerminalNodes[e],Name[PriorAction[t]]="Raise"]
AddMove[alicemove,fredraised];
</programlisting>

In the above, the first move, <varname>deal</varname>, is a chance
move. It is added at the root node of the game.  The second move is
called <varname>fredmove</varname>, and is added at the terminal nodes
of the tree, since Fred gets to take this move for any draw of the
card.  Since there are two terminal nodes the call to
<function>AddMove</function> here is a listable call, and adds the
move to both terminal nodes of the tree.  The third move is called
<varname>alicemove</varname>. Alice only gets to move if Fred chooses
to raise.  So the step computing <varname>fredraised</varname>
identifies all of the terminal nodes whose prior action was named
<literal>"Raise"</literal>.  The move <varname>alicemove</varname> is
added at all of these nodes, via a listable call to
<function>AddMove</function>.  At this point, if you execute the
expression
<programlisting>
Display[e]
</programlisting>
you can launch the graphical interview to view the game
in its current state.  You will see that the game tree looks like the
game in <citation><xref linkend="Mye91"></citation>,
except there are no payoffs yet, and Fred
only has one information set.  This is because you did not yet account
for the fact that the deal is revealed to Fred.  You can reveal the
deal to Fred (but not to Alice) via
<programlisting>
Reveal[deal,{fred}];
</programlisting>
and if you now display the game, then except for the fact that no
payoffs have yet been defined, the game tree should look like that in
<citation><xref linkend="Mye91"></citation>.
Note that an alternate way to get the
information structure correct is to create separate information sets
for Fred's moves from the outset.  So, the expressions
<programlisting>
fredmove := NewInfoset[fred , {"Raise", "Fold"}];
AddMove[fredmove, TerminalNodes[e]];
</programlisting>
in the above example could be replaced with
<programlisting>
fredred := NewInfoset[fred , {"Raise", "Fold"}];
fredblack := NewInfoset[fred , {"Raise", "Fold"}];
AddMove[ fredred, RootNode[e]#1];
AddMove[ fredblack, RootNode[e]#2];
</programlisting>
(Here, the short form <literal>n#j</literal> for
<function>NthChild</function> is used to refer to the
<varname>j</varname>th child of node <varname>n</varname>).  A move
from the information set <varname>fredred</varname> is added to the
first child of the root node (which is the action for chance in which
the red card is selected) and a move from the second information set
<varname>fredblack</varname> is added to the second child of the root
node.  Now, since two separate information sets for Fred are created
from the outset, there is no need to reveal the deal to Fred.  As with
life in general, in the GCL there is usually more than one way to skin
a cat.
</para>

<para>
To complete construction of this game, we must now add payoffs. This
can be done with the following sequence of expressions
<programlisting>
ante := 1.00;
raise := 1.00;
win := SetPayoffs[NewOutcome[e, "Win"],{ante,-ante}];
winbig := SetPayoffs[NewOutcome[e, "Win Big"],{ante+raise,-ante-raise}];
lose := SetPayoffs[NewOutcome[e, "Lose"],{-ante,ante}];
losebig := SetPayoffs[NewOutcome[e, "Lose Big"],{-ante-raise,ante+raise}];
SetOutcome[TerminalNodes[e],{winbig,win,win,losebig,win,lose}]
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
This example has shown how to construct a simple game without any
recursive structure.  This game might be just as easily created in the
graphical interface.  The usefulness of the GCL in constructing games comes
when the game is larger, or has some repetitive structure to it.  In
Appendix A, part 1, we give an example showing how to construct a multi stage
holdout game using user defined functions.

<title>Saving and loading extensive forms</title>

<para>
Once an extensive form game has been constructed, it can be saved by
the expression
<programlisting>
SaveEfg[e, "filename.efg"]
</programlisting>
where <varname>e</varname> is the extensive form game, and
<filename>filename.efg</filename> is the filename of the file to be created.  It is
recommended that the filename extension <filename>.efg</filename> be used when
saving extensive form games, as the Gambit graphical user interface
recognizes this extension as containing extensive form games.  Once an
extensive form game has been saved to an external file, it can be
loaded by the function <function>LoadEfg</function>, as follows:
<programlisting>
e := LoadEfg["filename.efg"]
</programlisting>
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Creating a normal form from an extensive form</title>

<para>
A normal form game can also be created from an extensive form game.
If <varname>e</varname> is an extensive form game, then the expression
<programlisting>
n := Nfg[e]
</programlisting>
will create a normal form game <varname>n</varname> which is the reduced normal
form game associated with the extensive form game <varname>e</varname>.
</para>

<para>
Strategies in the reduced normal form are given default names
consisting of a series of digits, where the <varname>j</varname>th
digit in the strategy name corresponds to the branch number taken at
the player's <varname>j</varname>th information set.  To illustrate,
here we create the reduced normal form of the game of poker
encountered earlier.
<programlisting>
GCL1:= e:=LoadEfg["poker.efg"]
GCL2:= << Name[Actions[e]]
{ { { Raise, Fold }, { Raise, Fold } },
  { { Meet, Pass } } }
GCL3:= n:=Nfg[e];
GCL4:= << Name[Strategies[n]]
{ { 11, 12, 21, 22 },
  { 1, 2 } }
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
In the normal form game, player 1 has four strategies.  Player 1's
second strategy has name <literal>12</literal>.  This indicates that the player
took action 1 (Raise) in the first information set, and action 2
(Fold) in the second information set.  
</para>

<para>
When a normal form game <varname>n</varname> is created from an
extensive form game, the GCL will ``remember'' the extensive form game
that <varname>n</varname> is associated with, as long as neither the
extensive or normal form game is edited.  Any mixed strategy solutions
computed on the normal form game <varname>n</varname> can be converted
back to a behavior strategy of the game <varname>e</varname> by using
the command <function>Behav</function>.  Thus
<programlisting>
n := Nfg[e];
m := EnumMixedSolve[n];
b := Behav[m]
</programlisting>
will convert the game <varname>e</varname> to reduced normal form, solve it using
the <function>EnumMixedSolve</function> algorithm, and then convert all mixed profiles found back
to behavior profiles, and display the list, <varname>b</varname> of behavior
profiles found. The above can also be done in one command without saving
intermediate steps as follows:  
<programlisting>
b := Behav[EnumMixedSolve[Nfg[e]]]
</programlisting>
</para>

<title>Solving games</title>

<para>
Every finite game has at least one Nash equilibrium
in either pure or mixed
strategies <citation><xref linkend="Nas50"></citation>.
Various refinements of Nash
equilibrium are frequently used to select reasonable equilibria in
games with multiple equilibria.  The most commonly studied refinements
are perfect and proper equilibria for normal form games,
and subgame perfect and sequential equilibria for
extensive form games.
<footnote>
<para>Definitions of perfect and subgame perfect
equilibria are from
<citation><xref linkend="Sel75"></citation>,
proper equilibrium from <citation><xref linkend="Mye78"></citation>,
and sequential equilibrium from
<citation><xref linkend="KreWil82"></citation>.
See 
<citation><xref linkend="vanD83"></citation> or
<citation><xref linkend="Mye91"></citation>
for general treatments of refinements.
</para>
</footnote>
</para>

<para>
The best way to compute an equilibrium depends on many factors, the
most important of which are the number of players, the number of
equilibrium you want to find, and what kind of refinement you are
looking for.  For a detailed discussion of these issues, see
<citation><xref linkend="McKMcL96"></citation>.
In general, it is easier to solve two person
games than n-person games, it is easier to find one equilibrium than
to find all, and it is easier to find a Nash equilibrium than a
refinement.
</para>

<para>
The computational complexity of solving for equilibria of games also
typically at least exponential in the number of strategies or actions.
Consequently, you will find it quite easy to build games in Gambit
which cannot be solved (in any reasonable amount of time) by Gambit.
</para>

<para>
When solving games of any reasonable size, it is therefore good to try
and simplify things as much as possible before launching into a
solution algorithm.  One way of simplifying a game is by reducing the
size of the strategy set by elimination of dominated strategies.  For
extensive form games, a second way of simplifying the problem is by
taking account of the subgame structure of the game, and then
recursively solve the game from the end.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Supports and dominance elimination</title>

<para>
The GCL data types <type>NFSUPPORT</type> and <type>EFSUPPORT</type> are used
to represent a support in a normal or extensive form game.  A
support for a normal form game is a selection of non-empty subsets of
strategies for all players in the game.  A support for an extensive
form game is a selection of non-empty subsets of actions for all
information sets in the game.
</para>

<para>
The main use of supports is to represent the sets of strategies that
remain after dominated strategies have been eliminated from the game.
All of the built-in functions for solution algorithms in the GCL take
an <type>NFSUPPORT</type> or <type>EFSUPPORT</type>
as their first parameter,
hence can be run on any support of the game.
</para>

<para>
The call <literal>Support[g]</literal> returns the full support
of the normal or extensive form game <varname>g</varname>.  The full support is
the support in which no strategies (or actions) have been eliminated.
The function <function>UnDominated</function> can be used to find the dominated
strategies or strategies in a support of a game.  <function>UnDominated</function>
returns a support containing the undominated strategies for each
player (or actions for each information set, in the case of extensive
for games).  By default weak domination is used, and only domination
by pure strategies is considered. By setting one or both of the
optional parameters <parameter>strong</parameter> and
<parameter>mixed</parameter> to <literal>True</literal>, strong
domination can be used, and domination by mixed strateies can be
considered.
<footnote>
<para>Elimination by mixed strategies is only
implemented for normal form games.
</para>
</footnote>
The following
sequence of expressions shows the computation of the full supports and
the support resulting from weak dominance elimination in the extensive
and reduced normal form of the poker example of the previous chapter.
<programlisting>
GCL1:= e:=LoadEfg["poker.efg"]
GCL2:= efsupp:=UnDominated[e]
GCL3:= << Name[Actions[e]]
{ { { Raise, Fold }, { Raise, Fold } },
  { { Meet, Pass } } }
GCL4:= << Name[Actions[efsupp]]
{ { { Raise }, { Raise, Fold } },
  { { Meet, Pass } } }
GCL5:= n:=Nfg[e];
GCL6:= nfsupp:=UnDominated[n];
GCL7:= << Name[Strategies[n]]
{ { 11, 12, 21, 22 },
  { 1, 2 } }
GCL8:= << Name[Strategies[nfsupp]]
{ { 11, 12 },
  { 1, 2 } }
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
In the above example, for the extensive form game, the action with
name "Fold" is dominated, and eliminated by <function>UnDominated</function>.
Correspondingly, in the reduced normal form game, the strategies in
which the first player takes the second action at the first
information set is eliminated.  
</para>

<para>
A user defined function <function>IterativeUnDominated</function>
can be used to
iteratively eliminate dominated strategies in a game, until no further
dominance elimination is possible.  This function returns the final
support.  So the program
<programlisting>
n:=LoadNfg["mygame.nfg"];
s:=IterativeUnDominated[n,strong->True,mixed->True];
</programlisting>
will find the set of all strategies that remain after iterative
elimination by mixed strategies of strongly dominated strategies in
the game <varname>n</varname>.
</para>

<para>
While the main use of supports is to represent strategies that
remain after dominance elimination, you can also construct your own
support for a game using the functions <function>RemoveStrategy</function>
and <function>AddStrategy</function>.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Subgames</title>

<para>
For extensive form games, Gambit recognizes and supports the notion of
a subgame.  If <varname>efg</varname> is an extensive form game, the
call <literal>Subgames[efg]</literal> returns a list of nodes
representing the roots of valid subgames.
</para>

<para>
You can control the way the extensive form solution algorithms deal
with subgames by ``marking'' or ``unmarking'' subgames.  All of the
extensive form solution algorithms recursively solve the extensive
form game by subgames, but only for subgames that are marked.  Terminal
marked subgames are solved first, and then for any solution of the
subgame, the parent game is pruned, plugging in the continuation value
generated by the terminal subgame.  The marked subgames that are now
terminal are then recursively solved in a similar manner, and so on,
until the game starting at the root node is reached.  Be warned that
if there are multiple equilibria to each subgame, the size of the set
of solutions to the full game that are generated by this procedure can
be exponential with the number of subgames.
</para>

<para>
When you first construct a game, the only subgame that is marked is
the root node of the tree.  This node always represents a valid
subgame, and it is not possible to unmark the root node.  If
<varname>node</varname> is the root of a valid non-trivial subgame, then the
functions <function>MarkSubgame</function> and <function>UnMarkSubgame</function> can be
used to mark and unmark the specific subgames starting at that node.
<function>MarkedSubgamd</function> can be used to check if the subgame is marked.
The user defined functions <function>MarkSubgames</function> and
<function>UnMarkSubgames</function> can be used to mark and unmark all valid
subgames in the game.  <function>MarkedSubgames</function>
returns a lsit of root
nodes of all currently marked subgames.
</para>

<para>
The technique of marking subgames can be used to control whether a
solution algorithm that finds Nash equilibria returns any Nash
equilibrium or only subgame perfect Nash equilibria of the game.  If
no subgames are marked, the algorithm will return Nash equilibria
which may not be subgame perfect.  If you first mark all subgames, the
algorithm will return subgame perfect equilibria.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Mixed and behavior strategy profiles</title>

<para>
The data types <type>MIXED</type> and <type>BEHAV</type> are used to represent
mixed and behavior strategy profiles for normal and extensive form
games, respectively.  Mixed and behavior strategy profiles can be
defined on any support of the game.  A mixed strategy profile is a
specification of a numeric value (usually interpreted as a
probability) for each strategy in the support.  Similarly, a behavior
strategy profile is a specification of a numeric value (usually
interpreted as a probability) for each action in the support.
</para>

<para>
The simplest way of generating a mixed profile for a game is to use
the built-in function <function>Centroid</function>, which generates a mixed or
behavior strategy profile in which every player adopts each of their
strategies (or each action in an information set) with equal
probability.  For example, if <varname>g</varname> is a variable representing an
extensive or normal form game, and <varname>s</varname> is a support for the game
<varname>g</varname>, then the calls <literal>Centroid[g]</literal> or
<literal>Centroid[s]</literal>
generate mixed strategy profiles for the game and support, respectively.
You can use the function <function>SetStrategyProbs</function> 
<function>SetActionProbs</function> to change
the strategy probabilites for a mixed or behavior profile.
You can also use the
standard user defined functions <function>Mixed</function> or 
<function>Behav</function> to
generate a mixed profile from a nested list of numeric data, as long
as the nested list is of the correct dimensions.
</para>

<para>

Basic arithmetic operations are defined on mixed and behavior profiles
as well.  So you can take linear combinations of mixed profiles to
create new mixed profiles, as illustrated in this example:
<programlisting>
GCL1:= n:=Nfg[{{{3,1},{0,0}},{{0,1},{3,0}},{{1,0},{1,3}}}];
GCL2:= << c:=Centroid[n]
(Mixed) { 1/3 1/3 1/3 }{ 1/2 1/2 }
GCL3:= << cc:=Mixed[n,{{1,0,0},{1,0}}]
(Mixed) { 1 0 0 }{ 1 0 }
GCL4:= << m:=1/2*c+1/2*cc
(Mixed) { 2/3 1/6 1/6 }{ 3/4 1/4 }
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
In most cases, the value assigned to an action or strategy is
interpreted as the probability with which a player adopts the
corresponding action or strategy.  However, the data for <type>MIXED</type>
or <type>BEHAV</type>
need not be legitimate probabilities.  For example, it would be valid
to create a mixed profile using the call
<literal>Mixed[n,{{1,2,3},{4,5}}]</literal>. Probabilities are not
required to add up to one, or even to be positive.  This feature is
especially useful in econometric analysis, as the <type>MIXED</type> and
<type>BEHAV</type> data types can be used to represent choice frequencies of
corresponding actions or strategies.  
</para>

<para>
All of the solution algorithms that operate on games or their supports
return lists of mixed or behavior profiles to representing the
solutions.  Some algorithms compute important additional information
about the profile that may not be recoverable from knowledge of just
the strategy probabilies.  Consequently, the <type>MIXED</type> an
<type>BEHAV</type> data types keep track of who created them, and what
properties are known about them.  A series of functions are available
to query profiles to return this information.  These functions are
listed in section on ``information about solutions'' in the
Categorical Function Reference chapter.  To view all of the
information that is known about a mixed or behavior profile, you can
change the format by which solutions are displayed using the
<function>Format</function> function.
</para>
