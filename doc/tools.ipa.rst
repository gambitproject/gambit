:program:`gambit-ipa`: Compute Nash equilibria in a strategic game using iterated polymatrix approximation
==========================================================================================================

:program:`gambit-ipa` reads a game on standard input and computes Nash
equilibria using an iterated polymatrix approximation approach
developed by Govindan and Wilson [GovWil04]_.
This program is a wrapper around the
`Gametracer 0.2 <http://dags.stanford.edu/Games/gametracer.html>`_
implementation by Ben Blum and Christian Shelton.

.. program:: gambit-ipa

.. cmdoption:: -d

   Express all output using decimal representations
   with the specified number of digits.

.. cmdoption:: -h

   Prints a help message listing the available options.

.. cmdoption:: -q

   Suppresses printing of the banner at program launch.
