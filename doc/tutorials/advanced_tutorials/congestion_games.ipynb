    "# Congestion Games and Weighted Congestion Games\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore **congestion games**, a fundamental class of games in algorithmic game theory. Congestion games model scenarios where multiple self-interested players share a common set of resources (such as routes in a network), and the cost incurred by each player depends only on the number of players choosing the same resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important theoretical result is that all **unweighted congestion games** are exact potential games, which guarantees the existence of at least one pure Nash equilibrium. However, this property does not generally hold for **weighted congestion games**, where players have different weights (demands) affecting the resources. In the weighted case, pure Nash equilibria are not guaranteed, but mixed Nash equilibria still exist.\n",
