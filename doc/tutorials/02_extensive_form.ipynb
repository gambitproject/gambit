    "# 2) Extensive form games\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first tutorial, we used Gambit to set up the Prisoner's Dilemma, an example of a normal (strategic) form game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gambit can also be used to set up extensive form games; the game is represented as a tree, where each node represents a decision point for a player, and the branches represent the possible actions they can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: One-shot trust game with binary actions**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kreps (1990)](#references) introduced a game commonly referred to as the **trust game**.\n",
    "We will build a one-shot version of this game using Gambit's game transformation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game can be defined as follows:\n",
    "- There are two players, a **Buyer** and a **Seller**.\n",
    "- The Buyer moves first and has two actions, **Trust** or **Not trust**.\n",
    "- If the Buyer chooses **Not trust**, then the game ends, and both players receive payoffs of `0`.\n",
    "- If the Buyer chooses **Trust**, then the Seller has a choice with two actions, **Honor** or **Abuse**.\n",
    "- If the Seller chooses **Honor**, both players receive payoffs of `1`;\n",
    "- If the Seller chooses **Abuse**, the Buyer receives a payoff of `-1` and the Seller receives a payoff of `2`.\n",
    "\n",
