    "# One-card poker game with private information\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll create an extensive form representation of a one-card poker game ([Mye91](#mye91)) and use it to demonstrate and explain the following with Gambit:\n",

    "1. Setting up an extensive form game with imperfect information\n",
    "2. Using information sets\n",
    "3. [Retrieving player payoff tables from the game](#)\n",
    "4. [Computing Nash equilibria](#)\n",
    "5. [Acceptance criteria for Nash equilibria](#)\n",
    "\n",
    "A version of this game also appears in [RUW08](#ruw08), as a classroom game under the name \"stripped-down poker\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is perhaps the simplest interesting game with imperfect information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our version of the game, there are two players, **Alice** and **Bob**, and a deck of cards, with equal numbers of **King** and **Queen** cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The game begins with each player putting $1 in the pot.\n",
    "- A card is dealt at random to Alice\n",
    "    - Alice observes her card\n",
    "    - Bob does not observe the card\n",
    "- Alice then chooses either to **Raise** or to **Fold**.\n",
    "    - If she chooses to Fold, Bob wins the pot and the game ends.\n",
    "    - If she chooses to Raise, she adds another $1 to the pot.\n",
    "- Bob then chooses either to **Meet** or **Pass**.\n",
    "    - If he chooses to Pass, Alice wins the pot and the game ends.\n",
    "    - If he chooses to Meet, he adds another $1 to the pot.\n",
    "- There is then a showdown, in which Alice reveals her card.\n",
    "    - If she has a King, then she wins the pot;\n",
