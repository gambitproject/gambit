    "In this tutorial, we'll demo the basic features of the Gambit library for game theory, using the `PyGambit` Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes creating a `Game` object and using it to set up a strategic (normal) form game, the Prisoner's Dilemma, one of the most famous games in game theory.\n",

    "**The Prisoner's Dilemma**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic example in game theory that illustrates why two rational individuals who cannot communicate might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interest to do so. After being caught by the police for committing a crime, the two prisoners are separately offered a deal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If both stay silent (cooperate), they get light sentences.\n",
    "- If one defects (betrays the other) while the other stays silent, the defector goes free and the silent one gets a heavy sentence.\n",
    "- If both defect, they both get moderate sentences."
