    "This includes creating a `Game` object and using it to set up both normal and extensive form games, starting with the Prisoner's Dilemma, one of the most famous games in game theory.\n",

    "The Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic example in game theory that illustrates why two rational individuals who cannot communicate might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interest to do so. After being caught, the two prisoners are separately offered a deal:\n",
    "\n",
    "If both stay silent (cooperate), they get light sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one betrays (defects) while the other stays silent, the betrayer goes free and the silent one gets a heavy sentence.\n",
