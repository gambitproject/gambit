Python interface to Gambit library
==================================

As of the Gambit release of 0.2013.07.01, Gambit now supports a Python
interface for programmatic manipulation of games.  This section
documents this interface, which is under active development.
Refer to the :ref:`instructions for building the Python interface
<build-python>` to compile and install the Python extension.


A tutorial introduction
-----------------------

Building an extensive game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The function :func:`gambit.Game.new_tree` creates a new, trivial extensive game,
with no players, and only a root node::

  In [1]: import gambit

  In [2]: g = gambit.Game.new_tree()

  In [3]: len(g.players)
  Out[3]: 0

The game also has no title.  The :py:attr:`title` attribute provides
access to a game's title::

  In [4]: str(g)
  Out[4]: "<Game ''>"

  In [5]: g.title = "A simple poker example"

  In [6]: g.title
  Out[6]: 'A simple poker example'

  In [7]: str(g)
  Out[7]: "<Game 'A simple poker example'>"

The :py:attr:`players` attribute of a game is a collection of the
players.  As seen above, calling :py:meth:`len` on the set of players
gives the number of players in the game.  Adding a player is done
with the :py:meth:`add` member of :py:attr:`players`::

  In [8]: p = g.players.add("Alice")

  In [9]: p
  Out[9]: <Player [0] 'Alice' in game 'A simple poker example'>

Each player has a text string stored in the :py:attr:`label` attribute,
which is useful for human identification of players::

  In [10]: p.label
  Out[10]: 'Alice'

The :py:attr:`players` can be accessed like a Python list::

  In [11]: len(g.players)
  Out[11]: 1

  In [12]: g.players[0]
  Out[12]: <Player [0] 'Alice' in game 'A simple poker example'>

  In [13]: g.players
  Out[13]: [<Player [0] 'Alice' in game 'A simple poker example'>]


Building a strategic game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Games in strategic form are created using :func:`gambit.Game.new_table`, which
takes a list of integers specifying the number of strategies for
each player::

  In [1]: g = gambit.Game.new_table([2,2])

  In [2]: g.title = "A prisoner's dilemma game"

  In [3]: g.players[0].label = "Alphonse"

  In [4]: g.players[1].label = "Gaston"

  In [5]: g
  Out[5]: 
  NFG 1 R "A prisoner's dilemma game" { "Alphonse" "Gaston" }

  { { "1" "2" }
  { "1" "2" }
  }
  ""

  {
  }
  0 0 0 0 

The :attr:`strategies` collection for a player lists all the
strategies available for that player::

  In [6]: g.players[0].strategies
  Out[6]: [<Strategy [0] '1' for player 'Alphonse' in game 'A
  prisoner's dilemma game'>, 
           <Strategy [1] '2' for player 'Alphonse' in game 'A prisoner's dilemma game'>]

  In [7]: len(g.players[0].strategies)
  Out[7]: 2

  In [8]: g.players[0].strategies[0].label = "Cooperate"

  In [9]: g.players[0].strategies[1].label = "Defect"

  In [10]: g.players[0].strategies
  Out[10]: [<Strategy [0] 'Cooperate' for player 'Alphonse' in game 'A
  prisoner's dilemma game'>,
            <Strategy [1] 'Defect' for player 'Alphonse' in game 'A prisoner's dilemma game'>]

The outcome associated with a particular combination of strategies is
accessed by treating the game like an array. For a game :literal:`g`,
:literal:`g[i,j]` is the outcome where the first player plays his
:literal:`i` th strategy, and the second player plays his
:literal:`j` th strategy.  Payoffs associated with an outcome are set
or obtained by indexing the outcome by the player number.  For a
prisoner's dilemma game where the cooperative payoff is 8, the
betrayal payoff is 10, the sucker payoff is 2, and the noncooperative
(equilibrium) payoff is 5::

  In [11]: g[0,0][0] = 8

  In [12]: g[0,0][1] = 8

  In [13]: g[0,1][0] = 2

  In [14]: g[0,1][1] = 10

  In [15]: g[1,0][0] = 10

  In [16]: g[1,1][1] = 2

  In [17]: g[1,0][1] = 2

  In [18]: g[1,1][0] = 5

  In [19]: g[1,1][1] = 5



Reading a game from a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Games stored in existing Gambit savefiles in either the .efg or .nfg
formats can be loaded using :func:`gambit.Game.read_game`::

  In [1]: g = gambit.Game.read_game("e02.nfg")

  In [2]: g
  Out[2]: 
  NFG 1 R "Selten (IJGT, 75), Figure 2, normal form" { "Player 1" "Player 2" }

  { { "1" "2" "3" }
  { "1" "2" }
  }
  ""

  {
  { "" 1, 1 }
  { "" 0, 2 }
  { "" 0, 2 }
  { "" 1, 1 }
  { "" 0, 3 }
  { "" 2, 0 }
  }
  1 2 3 4 5 6

Iterating the pure strategy profiles in a game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each entry in a strategic game corresponds to the outcome arising from
a particular combination fo pure strategies played by the players.
The property :attr:`gambit.Gambit.contingencies` is the collection of
all such combinations.  Iterating over the contingencies collection
visits each pure strategy profile possible in the game::

   In [1]: g = gambit.Game.read_game("e02.nfg")

   In [2]: list(g.contingencies)
   Out[2]: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1], [2, 0], [2, 1]]

Each pure strategy profile can then be used to access individual
outcomes and payoffs in the game::

   In [3]: for profile in g.contingencies:
      ...:     print profile, g[profile][0], g[profile][1]
      ...:     
   [0, 0] 1 1
   [0, 1] 1 1
   [1, 0] 0 2
   [1, 1] 0 3
   [2, 0] 0 2
   [2, 1] 2 0








Mixed strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A mixed strategy object, which represents a probability distribution
over the pure strategies of a player, can be obtained using the
:meth:`gambit.Game.mixed_profile` method on a :class:`gambit.Game`
object.  Mixed strategies are initialized to uniform randomization
over all strategies for all players.

Mixed strategies can be indexed in three ways. Specifying a strategy
returns the probability of that strategy being played in the profile.
Specifying a player returns a list of probabilities, one for each
strategy available to the player.  Finally, mixed strategies can be
treated as a list indexed from 0 up to the number of total strategies
in the game minus one.  This latter behavior allows :py:func:`list` to
work as expected on a mixed strategy object::

  In [1]: g = gambit.Game.read_game("e02.nfg")

  In [2]: p = g.mixed_profile()

  In [3]: list(p)
  Out[3]: [0.33333333333333331, 0.33333333333333331, 0.33333333333333331, 0.5, 0.5]

  In [4]: p[g.players[0]]
  Out[4]: [0.33333333333333331, 0.33333333333333331, 0.33333333333333331]

  In [5]: p[g.players[1].strategies[0]]
  Out[5]: 0.5

The expected payoff to a player is obtained using
:meth:`gambit.MixedProfile.payoff`::

  In [6]: p.payoff(g.players[0])
  Out[6]: 0.66666666666666663

The standalone expected payoff to playing a given strategy, assuming
all other players play according to the profile, is obtained using
:meth:`gambit.MixedProfile.strategy_value`::

  In [7]: p.strategy_value(g.players[0].strategies[2])
  Out[7]: 1.0


Computing Nash equilibria
-------------------------

Interfaces to algorithms for computing Nash equilibria are collected
in the module :mod:`gambit.nash`.  Each algorithm is encapsulated in
its own class.

Algorithms with the word "External" in the class name operate by
creating a subprocess, which calls the corresponding Gambit
:ref:`command-line tool <command-line>`.  Therefore, a working
Gambit installation needs to be in place, with the command-line tools
located in the executable search path.

======================    ========================
Method                    Python class
======================    ========================
gambit-enumpure           ExternalEnumPureSolver
gambit-enummixed          ExternalEnumMixedSolver
gambit-lp                 ExternalLPSolver
gambit-lcp                ExternalLCPSolver
gambit-simpdiv            ExternalSimpdivSolver
gambit-gnm                ExternalGlobalNewtonSolver
gambit-enumpoly           ExternalEnumPolySolver
gambit-liap               ExternalLyapunovSolver
gambit-ipa                ExternalIteratedPolymatrixSolver
gambit-logit              ExternalLogitSolver
======================    ========================

For example, consider the game e02.nfg from the set of standard
Gambit examples.  This game has a continuum of equilibria, in which
the first player plays his first strategty with probability one,
and the second player plays a mixed strategy, placing at least
probability one-half on her first strategy::

  In [1]: g = gambit.Game.read_game("e02.nfg")

  In [2]: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalEnumPureSolver()

  In [3]: solver.solve(g)
  Out[3]: [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]]

  In [4]: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalEnumMixedSolver()

  In [5]: solver.solve(g)
  Out[5]: [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5]]

  In [6]: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalLogitSolver()

  In [7]: solver.solve(g)
  Out[7]: [[0.99999999997881173, 0.0, 2.1188267679986399e-11, 0.50001141005647654, 0.49998858994352352]]

In this example, the pure strategy solver returns the unique
equilibrium in pure strategies.  Solving using
:program:`gambit-enummixed` gives two equilibria, which are the
extreme points of the set of equilibria.  Solving by tracing the
quantal response equilibrium correspondence produces a close numerical
approximation to one equilibrium; in fact, the equilibrium which is
the limit of the principal branch is the one in which the second
player randomizes with equal probability on both strategies.

When a game's representation is in extensive form, these solvers
default to using the version of the algorithm which operates on the
extensive game, where available, and returns a list of
:py:class:`gambit.BehavProfile` objects.  This can be overridden when
calling :py:meth:`solve` via the ``use_strategic`` parameter::

  In [1]: g = gambit.Game.read_game("e02.efg")

  In [2]: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalLCPSolver()

  In [3]: solver.solve(g)
  Out[3]: [<NashProfile for 'Selten (IJGT, 75), Figure 2': [1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]>]

  In [4]: solver.solve(g, use_strategic=True)
  Out[4]: [<NashProfile for 'Selten (IJGT, 75), Figure 2': [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]>]

As this game is in extensive form, in the first call, the returned
profile is a :py:class:`gambit.BehavProfile`, while in the second, it
is a :py:class:`gambit.MixedProfile`.  While the set of equilibria is
not affected by whether behavior or mixed strategies are used, the
equilibria returned by specific solution methods may differ, when
using a call which does not necessarily return all equilibria.

It is also possible to convert between mixed and behavior strategic
profiles using :meth:`gambit.MixedProfile.as_behav` and 
:meth:`gambit.BehavProfile.as_mixed`.


Hashing and game objects
------------------------

Games, and objects representing elements within games, have a hash
method defined and are therefore hashable, usable as keys in
dictionaries and in Python sets.  The hash value is generated based on
the memory address at which the underlying C++ object is stored.  This
meets the requirements of a Python hash value, as distinct objects
will generate distinct hash values.  However, the hash value generated
will vary in different runs of a program.  As such, operations which
depend on the sequence of the has value may generate different output
in different runs of the program, most notably popping from a set, or
iterating over the keys in a dictionary where the keys are game objects.

   .. py:method:: insert_move(infoset[ , actions])

      Insert a move at a node, at the :py:class:`gambit.Infoset`
      ``infoset``.  Alternatively, a :py:class:`gambit.Player` can be
      passed as the information set, in which case the move is placed
      in a new information set for that player; in this instance, the
      number of ``actions`` at the new information set must be specified.
      The newly-inserted node takes the place of the node in the game
      tree, and the existing node becomes the first child of the new node.
