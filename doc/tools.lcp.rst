:program:`gambit-lcp`: Compute equilibria in a two-player game via linear complementarity
=========================================================================================


:program:`gambit-lcp` reads a two-player game on standard input and
computes Nash equilibria by finding solutions to a linear
complementarity problem. For extensive games, the program uses the
sequence form representation of the extensive game, as defined by
Koller, Megiddo, and von Stengel [KolMegSte94]_, and applies the
algorithm developed by Lemke. For strategic games, the program using
the method of Lemke and Howson [LemHow64]_.  There exist strategic
games for which some equilibria cannot be located by this method; see
Shapley [Sha74]_.

In a two-player strategic game, the set of Nash equilibria can be expressed
as the union of convex sets. This program will find extreme points
of those convex sets.  See :ref:`gambit-enummixed` for a method
which is guaranteed to find all the extreme points for a strategic
game.

.. program:: gambit-lcp

.. cmdoption:: -d

   By default, this program computes using exact
   rational arithmetic. Since the extreme points computed by this method
   are guaranteed to be rational when the payoffs in the game are
   rational, this permits exact computation of the equilibrium set.
   Computation using rational arithmetic is in general slow, however. For
   most games, acceptable results can be obtained by computing using the
   computer's native floating-point arithmetic. Using this flag enables
   computation in floating-point, and expresses all output using decimal
   representations with the specified number of digits.

.. cmdoption:: -S

   By default, the program uses behavior strategies for extensive
   games; this switch instructs the program to use reduced strategic game
   strategies for extensive games. (This has no effect for strategic
   games, since a strategic game is its own reduced strategic game.)

.. cmdoption:: -D

   .. versionadded:: 14.0.2

   The default output format for computed equilibria is a
   comma-separated list of strategy or action probabilities, suitable
   for postprocessing by automated tools.  Specifying `-D` instead
   causes the program to output greater detail on each equilbrium
   profile computed.

.. cmdoption:: -P

   By default, the program computes Nash equilibria in an extensive
   game. This switch instructs the program to find only equilibria
   which are subgame perfect.  (This has no effect for strategic
   games, since there are no proper subgames of a strategic game.)

.. cmdoption:: -h

   Prints a help message listing the available options.

.. cmdoption:: -q

   Suppresses printing of the banner at program launch.
