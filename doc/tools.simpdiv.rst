:program:`gambit-simpdiv`: Compute equilibria via simplicial subdivision
========================================================================

:program:`gambit-simpdiv` reads a game on standard input and computes
approximations to Nash equilibria using a simplicial subdivision
approach.

This program implements the algorithm of van der Laan, Talman, and van
Der Heyden [VTH87]_. The algorithm proceeds by constructing a triangulated grid
over the space of mixed strategy profiles, and uses a path-following
method to compute an approximate fixed point. This approximate fixed
point can then be used as a starting point on a refinement of the
grid. The program continues this process with finer and finer grids
until locating a mixed strategy profile at which the maximum regret is
small.

The algorithm begins with any mixed strategy profile consisting of
rational numbers as probabilities. Without any options, the algorithm
begins with the centroid, and computes one Nash equilibrium. To
attempt to compute other equilibria that may exist, use the
:option:`gambit-simpdiv -r` or :option:`gambit-simpdiv -s`
options to specify additional starting points for the algorithm.

.. program:: gambit-simpdiv

.. cmdoption:: -g

   Sets the granularity of the grid refinement. By
   default, when the grid is refined, the stepsize is cut in half, which
   corresponds to specifying `-g 2`. If this parameter is specified, the
   grid is refined at each step by a multiple of MULT .

.. cmdoption:: -h

   Prints a help message listing the available options.

.. cmdoption:: -n

   Randomly generate COUNT starting points. Only
   applicable if option :option:`gambit-simpdiv -r` is also specified.

.. cmdoption:: -q

   Suppresses printing of the banner at program launch.

.. cmdoption:: -r

   Generate random starting points with denominator DENOM.
   Since this algorithm operates on a grid, by its nature the
   probabilities it works with are always rational numbers. If this
   parameter is specified, starting points for the procedure are
   generated randomly using the uniform distribution over strategy
   profiles with probabilities having denominator DENOM.

.. cmdoption:: -s

   Specifies a file containing a list of starting points
   for the algorithm. The format of the file is comma-separated values,
   one mixed strategy profile per line, in the same format used for
   output of equilibria (excluding the initial NE tag).

.. cmdoption:: -v

   Sets verbose mode. In verbose mode, initial points, as well as
   the approximations computed at each grid refinement, are all output,
   in addition to the approximate equilibrium profile found.
