=======

Users installing Gambit have several options depending on their needs and their operating system.
We recommended new most users install the PyGambit package and read the :ref:`PyGambit documentation <pygambit>`.

Developers & contributors should refer to the :ref:`developer docs <developer>` which contain guides for building Gambit from source and contributing to the project.

Installing PyGambit

PyGambit is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pygambit/>`_. We recommend installing it into a Python virtual environment via `pip`::

   pip install pygambit
