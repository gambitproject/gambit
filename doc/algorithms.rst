.. _enumpure:

enumpure
--------

Reads a game on standard input and searches for pure-strategy Nash equilibria.

.. _enummixed:

enummixed
---------

Reads a two-player game on standard input and computes Nash equilibria using extreme point enumeration.

In a two-player strategic game, the set of Nash equilibria can be expressed as the union of convex sets.
This program generates all the extreme points of those convex sets. (Mangasarian [Man64]_)
This is a superset of the points generated by the path-following procedure of Lemke and Howson (see :ref:`lcp`).
It was shown by Shapley [Sha74]_ that there are equilibria not accessible via the method in :ref:`lcp`, whereas the output of
:program:`enummixed` is guaranteed to return all the extreme points.

.. _enumpoly:

enumpoly
--------

Reads a game on standard input and
computes Nash equilibria by solving systems of polynomial equations
and inequalities.

This program searches for all Nash equilibria in a strategic game
using a support enumeration approach. This approach computes all the
supports which could, in principle, be the support of a Nash
equilibrium.  For each candidate support, it attempts to compute
totally mixed equilibria on that support by successively subdividing
the space of mixed strategy profiles or mixed behavior profiles (as appropriate).
By using the fact that the equilibrium conditions imply a collection
of equations and inequalities which can be expressed as multilinear
polynomials, the subdivision constructed is such that each cell
contains either no equilibria or exactly one equilibrium.

For strategic games, the program searches supports in the order proposed
by Porter, Nudelman, and Shoham [PNS04]_.  For two-player games, this
prioritises supports for which both players have the same number of
strategies.  For games with three or more players, this prioritises
supports which have the fewest strategies in total.  For many classes
of games, this will tend to lower the average time until finding one equilibrium,
as well as finding the second equilibrium (if one exists).
