Updating the Games Catalog
==========================

This page covers the process for contributing to and updating Gambit's :ref:`Games Catalog <pygambit-catalog>`.
To do so, you will need to be able to submit pull request via GitHub; you may wish to first review the :ref:`contributor guidelines <contributing>`.

You can add games to the catalog saved in a valid representation :ref:`format <file-formats>`, e.g. for `.efg` for extensive form games.
Alternatively, you can define games for the catalog in *pygambit* code. You may wish to first review the :ref:`pygambit <pygambit>` docs pages.
