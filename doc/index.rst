Welcome to Gambit

**Gambit** is a library of game theory software and tools for the
construction and analysis of finite extensive and strategic games. 
Gambit is fully-cross platform, and is supported on Linux, Mac OS X,
and Microsoft Windows.

Key features of Gambit include:

* A :ref:`graphical user interface <section-gui>`, which uses
  `wxWidgets <http://www.wxwidgets.org>`_ to provide a common
  interface with native look-and-feel across platforms.
* All equilibrium-computing algorithms are available as
  :ref:`command-line tools <command-line>`, callable from scripts and
  other programs.
* A :ref:`Python API <pygambit>` for developing scripting applications.


Gambit is Free/Open Source software, released under the terms of the
`GNU General Public License <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.htmlâ€Ž>`_,
Version 2.

We hope you will find Gambit useful for both teaching and research
applications. If you do use Gambit in a class, or in a paper, we would
like to hear about it. We are especially interested in finding out
what you like about Gambit, and where you think improvements could be
made.

If you are citing Gambit in a paper, we suggest a citation of the form:
